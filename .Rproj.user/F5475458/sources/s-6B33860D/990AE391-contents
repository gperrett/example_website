## stan4bart for Causal Inference

`stan4bart` has applications for prediction and causal inference tasks. This post will focus on causal inference applications. 



### Data

We will use data from the [General Social Survey (GSS) administered by NORC](https://gss.norc.org). 

From the 1986 to the present, the GSS has run an ongoing experiment on how the framing of a program effects perceptions around government spending. 

#### Example of a ggplot

```{r}
x <- rbeta(500, 5, 2)
tibble(x) |>
ggplot(aes(x)) + 
  geom_histogram(col = 'black', fill = 4) + 
  theme_bw()
```
