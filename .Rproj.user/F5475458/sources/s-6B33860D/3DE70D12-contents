- Collaborated with Physics faculty to run a block randomized trial on a value affirmation intervention comparing in‑person implementation
against a digital implementation of the intervention.

- Wrote content for personalized communication interventions to increase college student motivation, performance and persistence.

### Research Assistant | Harackiewicz Research Lab | University of Wisconsin 2014-2016

- Coded and entered data for a field evaluation of brief educational interventions to increase STEM persistence among first generation and under‑represented college students.

- Assisted with data collection and analysis for randomized studies of education interventions aimed at increasing retention rate among community college students across the state of Wisconsin

### Research Assistant | Niedenthal Emotions Lab | University of Wisconsin 2015-2016

- Wrote IRB applications, assisted in the development of psychometric measures, oversaw behavioral experiments.

- Conducted literature reviews about affect and decision making, appraisal theory of emotions and functional accounts

### Intern | Fred Hutchinson Research Center | 2020 - 2021
- Collaborated with Professor Peter B. Gilbert on research projects related to causal inference and debiased/targeted machine learning with applications to the US-sponsored COVID-19 vaccine trials.
- Developed code pipelines for a unified statistical analysis of several US Government-sponsored COVID-19 vaccine trials, including those from Moderna and Johnson & Johnson.
- Co-authored several theoretical and applied publications appearing in journals including Biometrics, Science, and Nature.

### Ph.D. Student in Statistics | University of Washington | 2021 - Present
- Conducting advanced research in several areas, including causal inference, semiparametric statistics, debiased machine learning, statistical learning theory, and calibration for heterogeneous treatment effects, and causal inference after data-driven model-selection.
- Actively collaborating with researchers at the Fred Hutchinson Research Center on projects related to causal inference and debiased machine learning with a specific focus on randomized and observational COVID-19 vaccine trials.
